# TandemTechies
Quadrania may be saved, but only those with strength of heart and 
fortitude of mind can do so!
 
You, the long foretold one, must use your wits to defeat the forces of SigSegV!
To complete your quest, you will proceed through the known, and possibly unknown,
world of Quadrania to collect various components required for the
construction of the Tesselatoract. Only with the Tesselatoract in hand can you
hope to defeat the SigSegV!
 
Play alone or with friends!
